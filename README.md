# Multithreaded-Task-Scheduler
A C++ project implementing a multithreaded task scheduler with priority-based scheduling. It uses a vector-based queue, dynamic priority adjustments based on CPU/memory usage, and thread-safe logging. Demonstrates C++ multithreading, priority management, and scheduling algorithms for efficient task handling.
